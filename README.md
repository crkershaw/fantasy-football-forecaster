You can read a full explanation of the scripts and the outputs here:

These scripts scrape data on the Premier League Fantasy Football, aggregate it, then forecast how many points a player will score from their recent history. To do this it uses a variety of models, from linear regression to machine learning.


There are four main scripts:
1. Data collection
2. Data aggregation
3. Model training
4. Forecasting the ideal team (ideal team creation and graphing)

Note: all data is collected and modelled in 2019 - if trying to replicate this using these scripts, note that the FPL API and libraries may have changed since.
